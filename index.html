  <b>Web & HTML Basics</b>
  <p>
  <b>Web Structure</b>
  <br><br>
  The basic high level elements of "The Web" are user's computers running browsers, the Internet,
  and Servers. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>HTML</b>
  <br><br>
  HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>.  HTML documents make up the majority
  of the content on the web.
  </p>
 
  <p>
   <b>Tags and Elemnts</b>
   <br><br>
   HTML documents are comprised of <em>HTML Elements</em>. HTML Elements are defined using HTML Tags.
   Tags typically have begin and end components, with <em>void</em> type tags being
   an exception only having a single component.  An example of a void tag is the "br" tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Some tags have content, some have content and attributes.  Some tags are <em>inline</em>, menaing they work 'inline' with
   other HTML elements.  Some tags are <em>block</em> - which for now means they create an invisible block
   in the HTML document that can have attributes which we'll learn about later.'
